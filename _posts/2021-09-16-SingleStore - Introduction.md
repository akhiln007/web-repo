Data Latency:- When you are moving and transfering data between pipelines and ingest, you can do that real time in SingleStore

Query Latency:- If you are working with long running queries, queries that are running slow which takes more than 10mins or more in other databases can be made to run as quick as 10millisecs or near realtime depending on querytuning and optimization that you perform in SingleStore.

Concurrency:- SingleStore can support hundreds or thousands of live requests from thousands of users.
